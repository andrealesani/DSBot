attribute "part" saved in a JSON named with the user's sessionID. In the JSON file there is also an attribute "state"
in which the state of the fsm is updated. The method get_response receives as input the intent (extracted by the RASA
nlu) and the current fsm state and returns the next state and the response to be shown to the user. The output state
is used to update the user's JSON file """

  - intent: skip
    examples: |
      - I want to edit the pipeline manually
      - Let me do it by hand
      - Skip this step
      - There is no problem
      - I don't know
      - Change by hand
      - Manual edit
      - Skip
      - Continue to the next step
      - Continue

  - intent: run
    examples: |
      - Run the pipeline again
      - Update the graph
      - Refresh the results
      - I want to run it again
      - Run
      - Apply the changes
      - I am ready to run again
      - I am done editing
      - Done
      - I finished the work

  - intent: wrong_cluster_division
    examples: |
      - I see two clusters in the same
      - Cluster 2 should be split
      - Clusters 2 and 3 should be merged
      - Divide more the data
      - Points in clusters are too far
      - I want more clusters
      - I want less cluster
      - Change the number of groups
      - The groups are wrong
      - The clusters are wrong
      - I want to reduce the number of groups
      - Points of the clusters are mixed
      - Clusters overlap
      - Clusters are overlapped
      - Groups are too fragmented
      - Groups are fragmented
      - Too many clusters
      - Clusters are not divided
      - Too many colors
      - Groups overlap
      - The groups you found are different from the ones I see
      - Red points are too spread
      - Colors are mixed
      - Blue points are all around the graph
      - All the groups are overlapping
      - I would represent the groups differently
      - I clearly see some groups but they are not colored of the same color
      - The clusters you found are different from the ones I see
      - I clearly see some clusters but they are not colored of the same color
      - Clusters I see are not the clusters the algorithm found
      - You found different clusters with respect the one I see
      - Groups are overlapped
      - There are too many groups

  - intent: bad_silhouette
    examples: |
      - I want an higher silhouette
      - I don't like the silhouette
      - Improve the performances of clustering
      - Points in clusters are too far

  - intent: not_interpretable_results
    examples: |
      - I don't understand the clusters' meaning
      - I don't understand the groups' meaning
      - I don't understand the dots' meaning
      - What do these cluster mean?
      - What do these groups mean?
      - What do these dots mean?
      - What do these sets mean?
      - The dots are not meaningful
      - The clusters are not meaningful
      - The sets are not meaningful
      - The groups are not meaningful
      - Groups seems confuse
      - Clusters seem confuse
      - Colors seem confuse
      - Sets seem confuse
      - What do these groups mean?
      - What do these sets mean?
      - What do these colors mean?
      - What do these clusters mean?
      - I don't understand what I am looking at
      - Groups make no sense
      - Dots groups make no sense
      - Sets make no sense
      - Clusters make no sense

  - intent: fitting
    examples: |
      - Performances sucks
      - Unseen data have terrible performances
      - New data are labelled bad
      - It doesn' t predict the label in a good way
      - New data are labelled wrongly
      - The score is very high on training set but low in testing 
      - On new data predictions are wrong
      - It doesn't guess the right label
      - Predictions are bad
      - Predictions are wrong
      - The predictions are not good
      - The label is not guessed
      - It's useless
      - Guessings are wrong most of the times
      - It is not able to guess anything
      - Predictions are wrong most of the times
      - It seems to make the prediction wrong
      - When I use it with new data the model makes wrong predictions
      - Predictions are often wrong
      - Any guessing is wrong
      - It is useless
      - Guessing are wrong
      - The predictions are wrong too often
      - The score is high, but the predictions are low
      - Predictions are wrong
      - It predicts wrong 
      - It doesn't work with new data
      - I can't predict anything
      - Preditictions are not working
      - The predicion sucks
      - All the predictions are wrong
      - Too many predicitions are wrong
      - It doesn't predict anything
      - It doesn't work

      - Manual edit
      - Skip
      - Continue to the next step

  - intent: wrong_cluster_division
    examples: |
      - I see two clusters in the same
      - Cluster 2 should be split
      - Clusters 2 and 3 should be merged
      - Divide more the data
      - Points in clusters are too far
      - I want more clusters
      - I want less cluster
      - Change the number of groups
      - The groups are wrong
      - The clusters are wrong
      - I want to reduce the number of groups
      - Points of the clusters are mixed
      - Clusters overlap
      - Clusters are overlapped
      - Groups are too fragmented
      - Groups are fragmented
      - Too many clusters
      - Clusters are not divided
      - Too many colors
      - Groups overlap
      - The groups you found are different from the ones I see
      - Red points are too spread
      - Colors are mixed
      - Blue points are all around the graph
      - All the groups are overlapping
      - I would represent the groups differently
      - I clearly see some groups but they are not colored of the same color
      - The clusters you found are different from the ones I see
      - I clearly see some clusters but they are not colored of the same color
      - Clusters I see are not the clusters the algorithm found
      - You found different clusters with respect the one I see
      - Groups are overlapped
      - There are too many groups
      - I don’t like the crosses of the points
      - There are no visible clusters
      - I don’t like this graphical and spatial representation of nine clusters
      - There are no division between the clusters
      - I don’t understand what such clusters represent nor what the blue group represents
      - I don’t understand what such clusters represent
      - I do not understand blue dots
      - What the cluster represent


  - intent: bad_silhouette

    examples: |
      - I don't understand the clusters' meaning

      - I don't understand the dots' meaning
      - What do these cluster mean?
      - What do these groups mean?
      - What do these dots mean?
      - What do these sets mean?
      - The dots are not meaningful

      - The sets are not meaningful
      - The groups are not meaningful
      - Groups seems confuse
      - Clusters seem confuse

      - Sets seem confuse
      - What do these groups mean?
      - What do these sets mean?
      - What do these colors mean?
      - What do these clusters mean?
      - I don't understand what I am looking at
      - Groups make no sense
      - Dots groups make no sense
      - Sets make no sense
      - Clusters make no sense
      - I do not like the results
      - Can you change the visualization? 
      - I do not like the visualization
      - I don’t like the representation
      - The clusters are not defined
      - There is not a clear division

      - The predictions are wrong too often
      - The score is high, but the predictions are low
      - Predictions are wrong
      - It predicts wrong 
      - It doesn't work with new data
      - I can't predict anything
      - Preditictions are not working
